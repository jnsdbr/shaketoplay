# ShakeToPlay

This is an example app which uses tone.js & gyro.js to modify the playbackRate of a mp3 file. In order to increase the playbackRate you have to shake your phone up and down. After a few seconds the playbackRate will decrease again and you have to repeat the shaking process.

**Important**: The Tone.Buffer takes ages to load the mp3 file - this part needs some optimization!
